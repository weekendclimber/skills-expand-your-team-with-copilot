## How to Use These Templates

1. **Go to the Issues section** of the GitHub repository
2. **Click "New issue"**
3. **Choose the appropriate template** from the list
4. **Fill out all required fields** - the more detail you provide, the easier it will be for the coding agent to help you
5. **Submit the issue**

## Tips for Writing Good Issues

- **Be specific:** Instead of "fix the website," say "students can't register for Chess Club"
- **Include examples:** If you want something to look different, describe what you like about other websites
- **Mention deadlines:** If you need changes by a specific date, include that information
- **Think about impact:** Consider how your request might affect students, other teachers, or the system

## Getting Help

If you're not sure which template to use or need help filling out a form:
- Use the **General Question** template to ask for guidance

- Ask a colleague who has used the system before

These templates are designed to gather all the information needed for a GitHub Copilot coding agent to implement your requests efficiently and accurately.
